## You can make a difference in your neighbourhood today.

### Modern Living and Natural Beauty

Royalwood is a true gem within our wonderful city, offering a balance of modern homes, nature, and outdoor recreation. Royalwood has a mix of single detached homes, townhouses, and condos that suit different lifestyles and budgets. Most of the homes in Royalwood were built after 2000, so they have modern designs and features (many with stunning views of the river or the forest).

Royalwood is surrounded by green spaces that provide a serene and scenic environment. The neighbourhood is home to the Bois-des-Esprits Urban Forest, which is the largest remaining riverbank forest in the city. This 47 hectare urban forest is an integral part of the 27 km Seine River Greenway that connects various parks and trails along the river. The forest is an extremely popular destination for residents and visitors alike who enjoy walking, biking, nature watching, kayakings, canoeing, and fishing in this natural oasis.
