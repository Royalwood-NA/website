## RNA Membership Vote

### Your voice matters...

Our first membership vote is upon us!

We need to decide whether we want to apply for a MB Government Green Team Grant. This would provide full funding for employees to perform general upkeep of the community May - Sep.

We also need to decide which weekend to hold our community garage sale (or if we even wish to have a community garage sale endorsed by the RNA).

The vote is open to all RNA members who have paid their annual dues.

The vote will be open until **noon** on **Thu, Feb 8, 2024**.
