## Community Garage Sale

### Get your sale on

Whether you are selling or buying, you are sure to have a blast at the Rpyalwood Community Sale on **Saturday, June 1 and Sunday June 2**.

The Royalwood Community Sale has always been a popular event, rain or shine and this year is sure to continue the tradition.

If you have a few items and are not sure if you want to have a sale, please consider joining forces with your neighbours. The more people who paricipate, the more fun we will all have together!

We will have signage, newpaper articles, social media posts, and possibly some radio coverage to advertise the event. So start getting your tables ready and practice your haggling skills!
