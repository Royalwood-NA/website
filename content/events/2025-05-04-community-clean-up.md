## Community Cleanup

### Caring community members, making a difference, together

Please consider joining in with your neighbours to tidy up the community on **Saturday, May 4, 10am @ 2pm**.

This is a great opportunity to enjoy the nice weather, get some exercise, meet up with your neighbours, and help spruce up out neighbourhood. Our past cleanup events have been well attended and the kids especially seem to enjoy them (great way to help build community spirit within our younger neighbours!).

Take Pride Winnipeg is helping out by making litter sticks and bags available for those who would like some supplies.

Please [register](https://forms.gle/NFgJZo6hrbvucsMU6) for the event so we can provide you with the equipment pick up location and have an idea of how many people to expect.

We hope to see you all out there!
