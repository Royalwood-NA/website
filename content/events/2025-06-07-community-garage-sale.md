## Community Garage Sale

### Calling all bargain hunters

The much anticipated Royalwood Community Sale will be held on the _first weekend of June_ - **Saturday, June 7 and Sunday June 8**.

The Royalwood Community Sale has always been a popular event, rain or shine and this year is sure to continue the tradition.

If you have a few items and are not sure if you want to have a sale, please consider joining forces with your neighbours. The more people who paricipate, the more fun we will all have together!

We will have signage, newpaper articles and social media posts to advertise the event. Please help spread the word in your circles as well.
